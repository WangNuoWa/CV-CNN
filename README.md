Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network and Its Application in PoSAR Image Classification   

Requirements:   
Matlab   

Experimental steps:     
The test demo is on Flevoland dataset acquired by the AIRSAR sensor with L band.   
run ./Test Demo/TestDemo.m to evaluate the performance of the CV-CNN in PolSAR image classification    
    
The CV-CNN folder stores the implementation process of CV-CNN.    

Reference: This CV-CNN code is created based on the DeepLearnToolbox, which is a real CNN open source toolbox.
